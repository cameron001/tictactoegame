# tictactoegame

This is a basic tic tac toe game made with flutter. I've never used flutter before, so I made this by following a tutorial by Johannes Milke on how to make a tic tac toe game in flutter. I did add some features however such as a scoreboard, and customized the coloring. I want to give proper credit where it is due so here is the link to the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXTbch6AvuE&ab_channel=JohannesMilke
